        <h1>Offensive Security Intro</h1>

        <h2>What is this page about?</h2>
        <p>
            Hello everyone, this is <strong>NotAlive.</strong>
            <br>
            In this page I will be summarizing the <strong>Offensive Security Intro</strong> Room from <strong>tryhackme</strong>.
            <br>
            Mainly if you are new I would recommend not to read this as this is something for <em><strong>revision</strong></em>.
            <br>
            Let's get started.
        </p>
        <h2>1. What is Offensive Security?</h2>
        <p>
            "To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one."
            <br>
            This is what the Offensive Security Intro is all about.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Hack your first machine</h2>
        <p>
            In this task we will be using tool like Gobuster, to find hidden directories of a bank site and transfer money to another account.
            <br>
            First, we should start the VM and only it's on, open the terminal.
            <br>
            Then we run gobuster on the terminal like
            <pre><code>gobuster dir -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt</code></pre>
            Then we transfer $2000 from account 2276 to account 8881
            That's it for the task given.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Careers in Cyber Security</h2>
        <p>
            In this they talk about what careers are there in offensive security, like <strong>Penetration tester</strong>, <strong>Red Teamer</strong>, <strong>Security Engineer</strong>.
            <br>
            That's all there was actually, it's pretty basic.
        </p>
